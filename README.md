# SpeechRecognitionGameControl
This is a simple program in C that uses the Pocketsphinx library by CMU. The library is used along with Unity3D to demo a voice activated control to complete an action in a game.

All the coding is done in the SpeechRecognitionGameControl/Source/PlatformerGame/Private/Player/PlatformerCharacter.cpp
